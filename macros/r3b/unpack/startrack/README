WITH UCESB:
-1- To read the DAQ file (ie unpack) and create a root tree of raw data, execute:

	root -l startrack_ucesb.C

This creates the root file: startrack_0001.root in FAIR/

-2- To Reconstructing full timestamps for each hit from:
root -l 
.L startrackTimeSort.C
startrackTimeSort("/home/mala/FAIR/startrack_0001.root","OutTest.root")





PRIOR TO UCESB:

-1- To read the DAQ file (ie unpack) and create a root tree of raw data, execute:

	root -l startrackUnpacklmd.C

This creates the root file: startrack_raw_data.root


-2- To Reconstructing full timestamps for each hit from:
root -l 
.L startrackTimeOrder.C
startrackTimeOrder("startrack_raw_data.root","OutTest.root")
