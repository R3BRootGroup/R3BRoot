== Overview of the Califa classes ==

=== TClonesArray data (typically FairMultiLinkedData) ===
Event data on various levels.
Generally in ../r3bdata/califaData/.
Event data classes will be written [[like this]] in this file.  

=== (Main) FairTasks: ===
Classes generating new, higher level TClonesArray data from
existing data.
Tasks will be written in double curly braces here.

Tasks are:
{{./sim/R3BCalifaDigitizer.h}}
{{./unpack/R3BCalifaMapped2CrystalCal.h}}
{{./unpack/R3BCalifaCrystalCal2CrystalCalPID.h}}
{{./R3BCalifaCrystalCal2Hit.h}}

=== Parameter containers ===

These files generally hold channel-specific data used for calibration and the like.

./pars/R3BCalifaHitPar.h
./pars/R3BCalifaMappingPar.h
./pars/R3BCalifaCrystalCalPar.h
./pars/R3BCalifaContFact.h

To make sure that these are impossible to create/edit/view by unauthorized programs such as
text editors or shell scripts, these classes are generally serialized to ROOT's exclusive binary
only .root format. (There exist apostate rumors of a legacy FairParAsciiFileIo format which is
readable by both humans and 3rd party tools.)

=== ana: optional FairTasks ===
{{./ana/R3BCalifaMapped2CrystalCalPar.h}} -- generate a new calibration file from a source run.
{{./ana/R3BCalifaOnlineSpectra.h}}
{{./ana/R3BCalifaDemoOnlineSpectra.h}}
{{./ana/R3BCalifaCrystalCalDataAnalysis.h}}

=== other ===

./R3BCalifaGeometry.h   -- helper class to fetch infos on the positions and orientation of the crystals
./ROOT_template_hacks.h -- helper class to wrap ROOT stuff in a std c++ way
./CalifaLinkDef.h       -- linking directives for CINT. 
../geometry/califa*.root -- 14 different ROOT-only binary files containing the material and orientation
of the crystals and holding structure. At one point, these were probably generated by any of the 9 files matching
../macros/r3b/geo/create_califa*.C. The pigeonhole principle suggests that there is not a bijection between
the latter and the former. 

== Califa processing chains ==
=== simulation branch ===

./sim/R3BCalifa.h
 generates a data structure called
 [[../r3bdata/califaData/R3BCalifaPoint.h]],
 which is then used by 
{{./sim/R3BCalifaDigitizer.h}}
 to generate the simulation version of
[[../r3bdata/califaData/R3BCalifaCrystalCalData.h]].

=== unpack / experiment data branch ===

../r3bsource/R3BCalifaFebexReader.h is involved in parsing the lmd (with help from ucesb) to generate
[[../r3bdata/califaData/R3BCalifaMappedData.h]].
This is then read by {{./unpack/R3BCalifaMapped2CrystalCal.h}}
to generate [[../r3bdata/califaData/R3BCalifaCrystalCalData.h]] by applying per-channel, per-experiment
parameters (./pars/R3BCalifaCrystalCalPar.h). 

=== Processing to hit level aka clustering ===

[[../r3bdata/califaData/R3BCalifaCrystalCalData.h]] data from either source (sim/exp) is converted by
{{./R3BCalifaCrystalCal2Hit.h}}
to
[[../r3bdata/califaData/R3BCalifaHitData.h]]
