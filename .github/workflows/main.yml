# This is the main CI workflow for pull requests to the R3BRoot dev branch.

# To speed up this workflow, a public github action called 'cache' is used to
# cache important compiled files which are needed for multiple different runs.
# Currently there are two caches used for each job: one is related to the build
# of r3broot and another to some dependencies (such as googletest or ucesb). As
# can also be seen in the comments below, a new cache for the R3BRoot build
# process is created each time a pull request is being merged to the dev
# branch. The name (or key) of the cache follows the pattern of
# "r3broot-build-[job name]-[merge commit SHA]". If a run needs a specific
# cache file and fails to find it, any cache files containing
# "r3broot-build-[job name]-" will be used instead. On the other hand, the
# cache name for dependencies should always be the same (currently
# "r3broot-build-deps"). Each cache will be automatically deleted if not used
# for one week and the total size of all caches should not exceed 10GB for one
# project. More information about this cache management can be seen at
# https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows.

# The compiled files from the r3broot build process can not be directly cached.
# This is because for some reasons, cmake still treats those cached built files
# as new files and compiles everything again from scratch. Such a problem can
# be solved using another tool called 'ccache', which caches all compiled files
# during the build process and reuses them for the next build. Therefore, it is
# the cache folder of 'ccache' (defined by env variable $CCACHE_DIR) that is
# cached by the github action 'cache' instead of the build folder.

# To have successful and fast compilation and build processes, a Docker
# container embedded with the cvmfs is also used in the workflow. The cvmfs is
# very similar to sshfs which directly mounts a remote folder to the local
# filesystem. Using cvmfs inside a docker container further improves the speed
# of the workflow: saving install time for some essential dependencies (gcc,
# llvm clang, cvmfs etc.).

# It must be also noted that the speed of the worksflow varies a lot depending
# on the CPUs of the Github hosted servers. Current servers (free version) have at
# most 2 cores for each run and bigger servers (paid version) can have up
# to 4, 8 or even 16 cores.

# The workflow also submits the configure, build and test results to CDash
# (cmake dashborad) with two different models: Experimental and Continuous for
# the pull request and merge respectively. For the pull request (Experimental),
# the project is built with the cache files from ccache while for the merge
# (Continuous) it's built from scratch without using any cache files.

        # number of caches should be kept to a minimum. If there isn't too
