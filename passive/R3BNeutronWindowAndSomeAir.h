/* Place a neutron window (4mm steel) at xstart and air between start and stop
 * This can be used for NeuLAND simulations as there is currently no vacuum chamber implemented.
 * Instead, invert the problem: Use vacuum in the Cave and place a bunch o' air. Presto!
 * Bonus: No need to adjust the magnetic field for different beam energies.
 * The heavy ion will always fly through vacuum, and the neutrons through the right amount of material
