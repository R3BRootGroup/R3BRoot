# Overview of the ALPIDE silicon classes

The ALPIDE sensor is a particle detector based on Monolithic Active Pixels
and implemented in a 180 nm CMOS technology for imaging sensors. It has
been designed for the upgrade of the inner tracking system of the ALICE
experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider.
